Amazon made good sales from the consumer electronics sales in 2019, So I got this data from Kaggle a popular data science community where one could get data for a project so I could run an analysis to get a breakdown of her sales performance.
The Link to the data set is found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/knightbearr/sales-product-data?resource=download)

The analysis was to find out;
* How much was made by amazon in 2019
* The month the raked in the most revenue
* Time of the day that with the most traffick on the site
* The City that made the most orders
* The product with the most number of sales

## DATA ANALYSIS
I went through some process to produce insights from this data and this process are as follows;
* Data Collection
* Data Cleaning and Manipulation
* Data Visualisation
### DATA COLLECTION
The data for this project was gotten from kaggle. I downloaded each of the twelve months and loaded it in python using the library pandas.
### DATA CLEANING AND MANIPULATION
To make the data ready for use, I first had to join the 12 datasets together. Then I had a total number of 186,850 rows and of 6 columns. 
Cleaned the data by checking for missing values and removing them, I renamed a column so it can be easily understood, then typecasted some columns. 
I also had to strip off rows that are not in the year 2019. 
### DATA VISUALISATION
I made some visual basic visual to answer some simple question here, I cleaned the data so I could also use tableau to visual it. The visual could be found [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/chinemebudu.maxwell/viz/AmazonConsumerElectronicsDashboard/AmazonReport)
### CONCLUSION
From the data amazon genearated an annual revenue of $33,742,050, with the month generating the most revenue which I think would be majorly influenced by the festive period.
Also San Franscisco in California emerged as the city with the most number of sales. The best times to advertise where the time between the late morning hours of 10am - 2pm 
in the afternoon and the evening hours of 4pm - 9pm at night. The USB-C Charging cable toping the chart as the product with the number of sales.
